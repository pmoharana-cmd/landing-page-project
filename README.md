# Landing Page Project (Odin Project)

## Overview
This landing page was created as a practice for basic HTML and CSS styling. For HTML, I practiced good formatting and using divs to split up sections of my website. For CSS, I practiced using flex boxes, padding, and margins to help position items in my website and used color, font, background-color, and etc to help style the aesthetic of my website.

## Development
I worked on each section of the website individually before moving onto the next section. I first worked on the header, moving onto the main body elements, and then ending with the footer. I coded the HTML and sytled it will CSS as I went along. This website was built completely using Visual Studio Code
